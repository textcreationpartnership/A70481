            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A BRIEF ACCOUNT Of what Paſs'd at the Common Council HELD IN LONDON, On <hi>Fryday</hi> the 13th. day of <hi>May.</hi> 1681.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Mmediately before the Common Council Sate, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen (as is uſual) held their Court; in it was read a Letter from His Majeſty, Commanding them to ſend to Him forthwith upon the Receipt of His Letter, thoſe two Petitions that had been preſented to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen on the 28th. of <hi>April</hi> laſt. His Majeſty deſigning (it ſeems) to remove and take away all pretence or Colour, that might be taken by the Parties to thoſe Petitions, to raiſe any Diſputes or Conteſts in the Common Council about the ſubject matter of them.</p>
            <p>The Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen unanimouſly agreed to give Obedience to His Majeſties Letter, and to ſend two of their Members, Sir <hi>William Turner,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Moore</hi> to wait upon His Majeſty, and to deliver Him thoſe two Petitions.</p>
            <p>This being over, at Eleven of the Clock the Common Council ſate, and having diſpatch'd ſome City Buſineſs, Notice was taken of ſome Petitioners being at the Door, and a Motion was made that they might be called in.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and four more brought in the Petition; It was,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>That Thanks</hi> might be given to <hi>thoſe that</hi> had ſerved for the City in the <hi>late Houſe</hi> of Commons at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101040:2"/>(2.) <hi>That</hi> the Petition delivered in <hi>on the</hi> 28th. of <hi>April</hi> might be taken <hi>into Conſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The point of Thanks being firſt propoſed, was carried in the Affirmative; but not without Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>The ſecond point, where the Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Petition preſented the</hi> 28th. <hi>of</hi> April <hi>ſhould be taken into Conſideration AT THIS TIME, or not?</hi> was long Conteſted; at laſt they came to a Poll, which happened to be thus;
<list>
                  <item>11. Aldermen againſt taking the Petition into Conſideration.</item>
                  <item>7. Aldermen for it.</item>
                  <item>66. Common Council-men againſt taking the Petition into Conſideration.</item>
                  <item>84. Common Council-men for it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe that were <hi>not for taking the Petition into Conſideration</hi> did plead,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen had already laid it aſide, together with another Petition, preſented the ſame 28th day of <hi>April,</hi> wherein the Petitioners pretended to nothing elſe, but that His Majeſty might have their humble Thanks given Him for His late Gracious Declaration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen had, but an hour or two before, reſolved in Obedience to His Majeſty, to ſend both the ſaid Petitions of the 28th of <hi>April</hi> to His Majeſty to diſpoſe of as He ſhould think fit; Well hoping thereby to prevent any occaſion of difference that might ariſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Petition now contended for, containing Matters of State, no way proper for the Debate of that Aſſembly. Thoſe that were againſt it, proteſted, that they we e come thither to Treat and Reſolve of the concerns of the City, and were ready and deſirous to do their duty, in that behalf; But if any others would meddle with Matters of State (ſuch as the ſaid Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>other party</hi> went on with the <hi>Conſideration of the ſaid Petition,</hi> and appointed a Committee to draw up an Addreſs to His Majeſty, which being prepared, was read once, and without more ado paſt, and was voted to be preſented to His Majeſty, by the hands of Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> and ſix or ſeven more.</p>
            <p>This is the Sum of what paſt at the ſaid Common Council, by which it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
